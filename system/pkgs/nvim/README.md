# Neovim

I don't think I'll ever convert my Neovim configs to Nix. This seems like a huge undertaking for something as simple as copying the preferred config over to `~.config/nvim`.

I have two different configuration for Neovim:

- **custom_nvim**
  
  This is my configuration I built from scratch, based on ThePrimeagen's config. I never use it anymore but I couldn't brign myself to remove it, so here it stays.

- **astro_nvim**

  This is my custom config based on astro nvim. It is my daily driver for development work and includes some great plugins to create a cohesive IDE environment.
