# Compiled Themes

This directory contains compiled themes for neovim generated using my plugin [color-compiler.nvim](https://github.com/paradoxical-dev/color-compiler.nvim)

The files here are for storage purposes and will be copied over to `~/.local/share/nvim/color-compiler/`

Since they are compiled, the files will not be human readable and are not intended to be edited.

To use compiled themes simply set the userSettings argument`nvim.nvim_compile` to true in the flake.nix
