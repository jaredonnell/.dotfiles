Starting a switch NixOS. Have a base configuration (it sucks) which is not modular but includes the basic necesseties to get started.

I'll keep building on this and making it more modular using flakes and conditional configurations. I'll also try to learn the Nix way of doing things.

My overall goal is to have a system capable of supporting bleeding edge software like Arch in a reproducible and stable mannor
