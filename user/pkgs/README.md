# User Packages

This directory will contain the user defined packages. Mostly, this is  defined as packages which will be defined and customized from within home-manager, although there is some crossover.

Each directory of configureable packages will contain the corresponding configs for their theme and will have this file named after their theme name. Base configurations will also be included under the name `default.nix`
