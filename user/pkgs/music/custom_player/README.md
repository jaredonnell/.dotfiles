# Custom Music Player

This directory contains the necessary files to load up my custom music player made within AGS.

Credits to the original creator [qxb3](https://github.com/qxb3) from which I grabbed the initial framework and ported over to work with MPD.

The player is also configured to match the current system theme. and can have more themes added in the future by addign a custom css file to `themes/`.

[!TIP]
> Reference the existing css files to understand the slectors used in the player.
